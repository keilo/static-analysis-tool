This tutorial demonstrates the use of GIT on departmental server

Information needed:

- github username
- github email

STEP 0

Git is installed in /local/java/git/bin/git
To be able to access it you need to add the following line at the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

PATH=$PATH:/local/java/git/bin

STEP 1

Set up ssh keys on your account as explained here:
http://help.github.com/msysgit-key-setup/
Make sure you get the “successfully authenticated” message at the end.
If you already have existing ssh keys make sure you follow the instructions precisely.

STEP 2

Set up local directories and clone the public repository

mkdir project
cd project
git clone git@github.com:keilo/static-analysis-tool.git
cd static-analysis-tool

STEP 3

Configure your username/email

git config user.name "your github username"
git config user.email "your github email"

STEP 4

Changed README file in a text editor

git add README
git commit -m "changed readme"
git push origin master

That's it, your changes are now in the repository!

STEP 5

To pull changes done by someone else use:

git pull origin master
